To explore the mechanistic causes of these hallucinations, we create diagnostic datasets with subject-relation queries and adapt interpretability methods to trace hallucinations through internal model representations. We discover two general and distinct mechanistic causes of hallucinations shared across LMs (Llama-2, Pythia, GPT-J): 1) : insufficient subject attribute knowledge in lower layer MLPs, and 2) : failure to select the correct object attribute in upper layer attention heads. We also found these two internal mechanistic causes of hallucinations are reflected in external manifestations. Based on insights from our mechanistic analysis, we propose a novel hallucination mitigation method through targeted restoration of the LM{'}s internal fact recall pipeline, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines."

Our study reveals that the standard benchmarks consist of {\textbackslash}textgreater 60\% hallucinated responses, leading to models that not only hallucinate but even amplify hallucinations.

We discuss the challenges of training a generative neural dialogue model for such systems that is controlled to stay faithful to the evidence. Existing datasets contain a mix of conversational responses that are faithful to selected evidence as well as more subjective or chit-chat style responses. We propose different evaluation measures to disentangle these different styles of responses by quantifying the informativeness and objectivity. At training time, additional inputs based on these evaluation measures are given to the dialogue model. At generation time, these additional inputs act as stylistic controls that encourage the model to generate responses that are faithful to the provided evidence. We also investigate the usage of additional controls at decoding time using resampling techniques. In addition to automatic metrics, we perform a human evaluation study where raters judge the output of these controlled generation models to be generally more objective and faithful to the evidence compared to baseline dialogue systems.},

Integrating theories about the power of visual communication and the role played by uncertainty in undermining trust in public discourse, we explain the likely contribution of deepfakes to online disinformation. Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare people’s evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on social media. We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward generalized indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying recent challenges to online civic culture in democratic societies.},

We investigate these questions using a collection of domain-specific knowledge-based questions, specifically prompting ChatGPT to provide both an answer and supporting evidence in the form of references to external sources. We also investigate how different prompts impact answers and evidence. We find that ChatGPT provides correct or partially correct answers of the time; however, the suggested references actually only exist 14\% of the time. We further provide insights on the generated references that reveal common traits among the references that ChatGPT generates, and show how even if a reference provided by the model does exist, this reference often does not always support the claims ChatGPT attributes to it. Our findings are important because (1) they are the first systematic analysis of the references generated by ChatGPT in its answers; (2) they suggest that the model may leverage good quality information in producing correct answers, but is unable to attribute real evidence to support its answers.

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the quality of the answers and the references provided by ChatGPT for medical questions.
Patients and Methods
Three researchers asked ChatGPT 20 medical questions and prompted it to provide the corresponding references. The responses were evaluated for the quality of content by medical experts using a verbal numeric scale going from 0% to 100%. These experts were the corresponding authors of the 20 articles from where the medical questions were derived. We planned to evaluate 3 references per response for their pertinence, but this was amended on the basis of preliminary results showing that most references provided by ChatGPT were fabricated. This experimental observational study was conducted in February 2023.
Results
ChatGPT provided responses varying between 53 and 244 words long and reported 2 to 7 references per answer. Seventeen of the 20 invited raters provided feedback. The raters reported limited quality of the responses, with a median score of 60% (first and third quartiles: 50% and 85%, respectively). In addition, they identified major (n=5) and minor (n=7) factual errors among the 17 evaluated responses. Of the 59 references evaluated, 41 (69%) were fabricated, although they appeared real. Most fabricated citations used names of authors with previous relevant publications, a title that seemed pertinent and a credible journal format.
Conclusion
When asked multiple medical questions, ChatGPT provided answers of limited quality for scientific publication. More importantly, ChatGPT provided deceptively real references. Users of ChatGPT should pay particular attention to the references provided before integration into medical manuscripts.}

    abstract = { Background: The lack of incentives has been described as the rate-limiting step for data sharing. Currently, the evaluation of scientific productivity by academic institutions and funders has been heavily reliant upon the number of publications and citations, raising questions about the adequacy of such mechanisms to reward data generation and sharing. This article provides a systematic review of the current and proposed incentive mechanisms for researchers in biomedical sciences and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were queried for original research articles, editorials, and opinion articles on incentives for data sharing. Articles were included if they discussed incentive mechanisms for data sharing, were applicable to biomedical sciences, and were written in English. Results: Although coauthorship in return for the sharing of data is common, this might be incompatible with authorship guidelines and raise concerns over the ability of secondary analysts to contest the proposed research methods or conclusions that are drawn. Data publication, citation, and altmetrics have been proposed as alternative routes to credit data generators, which could address these disadvantages. Their primary downsides are that they are not well-established, it is difficult to acquire evidence to support their implementation, and that they could be gamed or give rise to novel forms of research misconduct. Conclusions: Alternative recognition mechanisms need to be more commonly used to generate evidence on their power to stimulate data sharing, and to assess where they fall short. There is ample discussion in policy documents on alternative crediting systems to work toward Open Science, which indicates that that there is an interest in working out more elaborate metascience programs. }

abstract = "Data for individual trials included in systematic reviews may be available in multiple sources. For example, a single trial might be reported in 2 journal articles and 3 conference abstracts. Because of differences across sources, source selection can influence the results of systematic reviews. We used our experience in the Multiple Data Sources in Systematic Reviews (MUDS) study, and evidence from previous studies, to develop practical guidance for using multiple data sources in systematic reviews. We recommend the following: (1) Specify which sources you will use. Before beginning a systematic review, consider which sources are likely to contain the most useful data. Try to identify all relevant reports and to extract information from the most reliable sources. (2) Link individual trials with multiple sources. Write to authors to determine which sources are likely related to the same trials. Use a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flowchart to document both the selection of trials and the selection of sources. (3) Follow a prespecified protocol for extracting trial characteristics from multiple sources. Identify differences among sources, and contact study authors to resolve differences if possible. (4) Prespecify outcomes and results to examine in the review and meta-analysis. In your protocol, describe how you will handle multiple outcomes within each domain of interest. Look for outcomes using all eligible sources. (5) Identify which data sources were included in the review. Consider whether the results might have been influenced by data sources used. (6) To reduce bias, and to reduce research waste, share the data used in your review.",

abstract = {The widespread adoption of ML has led to a high demand for GPU hardware and consequently, severe shortages of GPUs in the public cloud. Allocating a sufficient number of GPUs to train or fine-tune today's large ML models in a single cloud region is often difficult. Users can get access to more GPUs if they are willing to run a ML training job using devices across different geographical regions. However, GPU nodes are connected with lower network bandwidth and cloud providers charge extra for data transfers across geographical regions. In this work, we explore when and how it makes sense to leverage GPUs across zones and regions for distributed ML training. We analyze the throughput and cost impact of cross-region training based on the computation and communication patterns of different model parallelism strategies, develop a profile-based analytical model for estimating training throughput and cost, and provide guidelines for allocating geo-distributed resources efficiently. We find that although ML training throughput and cost with pure data parallelism degrades significantly when nodes span geographic regions, cross-region training with pipeline parallelism is practical.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently the most successful machine-learning technique for solving a variety of tasks, including language translation, image classification, and image generation. One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially. The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.}}

title = {Ethics of Big Data: Balancing Risk and Innovation},
year = {2012},
isbn = {1449311792},
publisher = {O'Reilly Media, Inc.},
abstract = { Ethics of Big Data author Kord Davis remembers exactly why he decided to write his book. "I found myself attending dozens of working meetings where a big data technologist would suggest a new product feature that was available using big data technology and having other folks in the room begin the thats-creepy-no-its-not debate," Davis says. "Those debates would end with no decision or action being agreed upon. I realized that in the absence of a common framework and vocabulary for discussion, people revert to their own moral code." Davis feels that his concise book is timely because, he says, "Big data is literally changing what we value and how we value things. "What I call big data's 'forcing function' is the result of the volume, velocity, and variety of big datas growth. Touching nearly all aspects of our lives, we are just now beginning to understand how it will influence our values and the meaning of words like identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation." And what we don't know can most definitely hurt us. "Individuals and organizations can suffer direct harm as a result of information being used in ways that it wasnt intended," Davis cautions. "This book addresses how to balance the benefits of big data innovation with the risk of harm from unintended consequences."}

Our study reveals that the standard benchmarks consist of {\textbackslash}textgreater 60\% hallucinated responses, leading to models that not only hallucinate but even amplify hallucinations. Our findings raise important questions on the quality of existing datasets and models trained using them. We make our annotations publicly available for future research.},

We discuss the challenges of training a generative neural dialogue model for such systems that is controlled to stay faithful to the evidence. Existing datasets contain a mix of conversational responses that are faithful to selected evidence as well as more subjective or chit-chat style responses. We propose different evaluation measures to disentangle these different styles of responses by quantifying the informativeness and objectivity. At training time, additional inputs based on these evaluation measures are given to the dialogue model. At generation time, these additional inputs act as stylistic controls that encourage the model to generate responses that are faithful to the provided evidence. We also investigate the usage of additional controls at decoding time using resampling techniques. In addition to automatic metrics, we perform a human evaluation study where raters judge the output of these controlled generation models to be generally more objective and faithful to the evidence compared to baseline dialogue systems.},

Integrating theories about the power of visual communication and the role played by uncertainty in undermining trust in public discourse, we explain the likely contribution of deepfakes to online disinformation. Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare people’s evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on social media. We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward generalized indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying recent challenges to online civic culture in democratic societies.},

We investigate these questions using a collection of domain-specific knowledge-based questions, specifically prompting ChatGPT to provide both an answer and supporting evidence in the form of references to external sources. We also investigate how different prompts impact answers and evidence. We find that ChatGPT provides correct or partially correct answers of the time; however, the suggested references actually only exist 14\% of the time. We further provide insights on the generated references that reveal common traits among the references that ChatGPT generates, and show how even if a reference provided by the model does exist, this reference often does not always support the claims ChatGPT attributes to it. Our findings are important because (1) they are the first systematic analysis of the references generated by ChatGPT in its answers; (2) they suggest that the model may leverage good quality information in producing correct answers, but is unable to attribute real evidence to support its answers.

abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the quality of the answers and the references provided by ChatGPT for medical questions.
Patients and Methods
Three researchers asked ChatGPT 20 medical questions and prompted it to provide the corresponding references. The responses were evaluated for the quality of content by medical experts using a verbal numeric scale going from 0% to 100%. These experts were the corresponding authors of the 20 articles from where the medical questions were derived. We planned to evaluate 3 references per response for their pertinence, but this was amended on the basis of preliminary results showing that most references provided by ChatGPT were fabricated. This experimental observational study was conducted in February 2023.
Results
ChatGPT provided responses varying between 53 and 244 words long and reported 2 to 7 references per answer. Seventeen of the 20 invited raters provided feedback. The raters reported limited quality of the responses, with a median score of 60% (first and third quartiles: 50% and 85%, respectively). In addition, they identified major (n=5) and minor (n=7) factual errors among the 17 evaluated responses. Of the 59 references evaluated, 41 (69%) were fabricated, although they appeared real. Most fabricated citations used names of authors with previous relevant publications, a title that seemed pertinent and a credible journal format.
Conclusion
When asked multiple medical questions, ChatGPT provided answers of limited quality for scientific publication. More importantly, ChatGPT provided deceptively real references. Users of ChatGPT should pay particular attention to the references provided before integration into medical manuscripts.}

    abstract = { Background: The lack of incentives has been described as the rate-limiting step for data sharing. Currently, the evaluation of scientific productivity by academic institutions and funders has been heavily reliant upon the number of publications and citations, raising questions about the adequacy of such mechanisms to reward data generation and sharing. This article provides a systematic review of the current and proposed incentive mechanisms for researchers in biomedical sciences and discusses their strengths and weaknesses. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were queried for original research articles, editorials, and opinion articles on incentives for data sharing. Articles were included if they discussed incentive mechanisms for data sharing, were applicable to biomedical sciences, and were written in English. Results: Although coauthorship in return for the sharing of data is common, this might be incompatible with authorship guidelines and raise concerns over the ability of secondary analysts to contest the proposed research methods or conclusions that are drawn. Data publication, citation, and altmetrics have been proposed as alternative routes to credit data generators, which could address these disadvantages. Their primary downsides are that they are not well-established, it is difficult to acquire evidence to support their implementation, and that they could be gamed or give rise to novel forms of research misconduct. Conclusions: Alternative recognition mechanisms need to be more commonly used to generate evidence on their power to stimulate data sharing, and to assess where they fall short. There is ample discussion in policy documents on alternative crediting systems to work toward Open Science, which indicates that that there is an interest in working out more elaborate metascience programs. }

abstract = "Data for individual trials included in systematic reviews may be available in multiple sources. For example, a single trial might be reported in 2 journal articles and 3 conference abstracts. Because of differences across sources, source selection can influence the results of systematic reviews. We used our experience in the Multiple Data Sources in Systematic Reviews (MUDS) study, and evidence from previous studies, to develop practical guidance for using multiple data sources in systematic reviews. We recommend the following: (1) Specify which sources you will use. Before beginning a systematic review, consider which sources are likely to contain the most useful data. Try to identify all relevant reports and to extract information from the most reliable sources. (2) Link individual trials with multiple sources. Write to authors to determine which sources are likely related to the same trials. Use a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flowchart to document both the selection of trials and the selection of sources. (3) Follow a prespecified protocol for extracting trial characteristics from multiple sources. Identify differences among sources, and contact study authors to resolve differences if possible. (4) Prespecify outcomes and results to examine in the review and meta-analysis. In your protocol, describe how you will handle multiple outcomes within each domain of interest. Look for outcomes using all eligible sources. (5) Identify which data sources were included in the review. Consider whether the results might have been influenced by data sources used. (6) To reduce bias, and to reduce research waste, share the data used in your review.",

abstract = {The widespread adoption of ML has led to a high demand for GPU hardware and consequently, severe shortages of GPUs in the public cloud. Allocating a sufficient number of GPUs to train or fine-tune today's large ML models in a single cloud region is often difficult. Users can get access to more GPUs if they are willing to run a ML training job using devices across different geographical regions. However, GPU nodes are connected with lower network bandwidth and cloud providers charge extra for data transfers across geographical regions. In this work, we explore when and how it makes sense to leverage GPUs across zones and regions for distributed ML training. We analyze the throughput and cost impact of cross-region training based on the computation and communication patterns of different model parallelism strategies, develop a profile-based analytical model for estimating training throughput and cost, and provide guidelines for allocating geo-distributed resources efficiently. We find that although ML training throughput and cost with pure data parallelism degrades significantly when nodes span geographic regions, cross-region training with pipeline parallelism is practical.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks are currently the most successful machine-learning technique for solving a variety of tasks, including language translation, image classification, and image generation. One weakness of such models is that, unlike humans, they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially. In this work we propose a practical solution to train such models sequentially by protecting the weights important for previous tasks. This approach, inspired by synaptic consolidation in neuroscience, enables state of the art results on multiple reinforcement learning problems experienced sequentially. The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.}}

year = {2012},
isbn = {1449311792},
publisher = {O'Reilly Media, Inc.},
abstract = { Ethics of Big Data author Kord Davis remembers exactly why he decided to write his book. "I found myself attending dozens of working meetings where a big data technologist would suggest a new product feature that was available using big data technology and having other folks in the room begin the thats-creepy-no-its-not debate," Davis says. "Those debates would end with no decision or action being agreed upon. I realized that in the absence of a common framework and vocabulary for discussion, people revert to their own moral code." Davis feels that his concise book is timely because, he says, "Big data is literally changing what we value and how we value things. "What I call big data's 'forcing function' is the result of the volume, velocity, and variety of big datas growth. Touching nearly all aspects of our lives, we are just now beginning to understand how it will influence our values and the meaning of words like identity, privacy, ownership, and reputation." And what we don't know can most definitely hurt us. "Individuals and organizations can suffer direct harm as a result of information being used in ways that it wasnt intended," Davis cautions. "This book addresses how to balance the benefits of big data innovation with the risk of harm from unintended consequences."}

 abstract = {Ronald Burt describes the social structural theory of competition that has developed through the last two decades. The contrast between perfect competition and monopoly is replaced with a network model of competition. The basic element in this account is the structural hole: a gap between two individuals with complementary resources or information. When the two are connected through a third individual as entrepreneur, the gap is filled, creating important advantages for the entrepreneur. Competitive advantage is a matter of access to structural holes in relation to market transactions.},

abstract = {While the most common transitive trust model for identity validation in use over Internet is the heavily centralized Public Key Infrastructure with Certification Authorities (PKI-CA) model, it is also possible to make use of a fully decentralized model: the Web of Trust (WoT). The best known implementation of this model is OpenPGP, derived from the original PGP software, first released in 1991. In order to be useful for a geographically-dispersed group of people, the WoT requires a keyserver network for key lookup and discovery — in a fittingly decentralized way. However, during the last decade, several high profile vulnerabilities have surfaced for the keyserver network. These vulnerabilities are not on the software that implements it, but on its basic protocols and assumptions, which make them particularly hard to solve. As a consequence, the keyserver network has shrinked, and it is facing an existential crisis. This paper outlines a work in progress for solving such a situation, acknowledging the need to keep a decentralized solution for transitive trust model viable, and the proposal to do so by modifying the admission criteria for new key certificates.},
