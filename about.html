            <h2>The Author</h2>
            <p><strong>Andrew Trask</strong> is a doctoral candidate at St. Hugh's College, University of Oxford. His research focuses on the intersection of deep learning, cryptography, and distributed systems, with particular emphasis on how these technologies can be combined to create AI systems that preserve attribution and control.</p>

            <h2>About This Thesis</h2>
            <p>This thesis, <em>Attribution-Based Control in AI Systems</em>, synthesizes recent breakthroughs across multiple fields to propose a new paradigm for AI development. It argues that many of AI's most pressing problems&mdash;hallucination, privacy, copyright, concentration of power, and value alignment&mdash;share a common technical root: the absence of attribution-based control.</p>

            <p>The thesis surveys existing techniques that could address this absence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep voting</strong> architectures that preserve source attribution through concatenation rather than addition</li>
                <li><strong>Structured transparency</strong> frameworks using cryptography to enable sharing without loss of control</li>
                <li><strong>Recursive delegation</strong> mechanisms that enable trust propagation at scale without centralization</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>The thesis proposes that AI can be transformed from a tool of central intelligence into a communication technology for <em>broad listening</em>&mdash;enabling each person to synthesize information from billions of sources, weighted through local trust relationships, and verified at each hop.</p>

            <p>This transformation could unlock 6+ orders of magnitude more data and compute for AI systems while aligning AI development with democratic values.</p>
