                    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                    <p>Chapters 2 and 3 developed the technical machinery to deliver ABC, but a close reading will
                        surface that the machinery has a flaw which must be addressed: trust at scale. As individuals,
                        AI users and data sources can evaluate perhaps 150 counter-parties by cultivating strong-tie
                        relationships with them. Yet, owing to scaling laws, NSAI requires evaluating millions of data
                        sources in order to curate as much data as standard AI systems.</p>
                    <p>Delegation of trust evaluation is therefore necessary, but it too has a fatal flaw: if AI users
                        and data sources delegate trust evaluation to a small collection of central parties, NSAI
                        collapses back into the system it was meant to replace. This chapter identifies the root issue
                        as high-branching nodes; any node connecting to millions cannot cultivate the strong-tie
                        relationships that trust evaluation requires. The chapter then prescribes recursive delegation
                        through low-branching networks as the remedy, yielding a new paradigm: <strong>broad
                            listening</strong>.</p>

                <section id="problem">
                    <h2>The Problem of ABC in Network-source AI</h2>

                    <p>Standard AI is trained on a curated dataset and can only leverage information obtained by the AI
                        owning entity to make predictions. In this way, standard AI is like a rudimentary, button-less,
                        hot-line telephone where users can only call the telephone provider for information, and the
                        telephone provider can only reply based on information they have gathered. Network-source AI
                        (NSAI) is like a modern telephone, giving users the ability to dial anyone in the world
                        directly, circumventing the data collection processes and opinions of the telephone provider.
                    </p>

                    <p>But while NSAI offers a technical capability for ABC, a subtle problem undermines it in practice:
                        the ability to dial is not the same as knowing whom to call, and the ability to reply is not the
                        same as knowing who to support with AI capability. Deep voting aggregates contributions
                        according to trust weights (the <em>intelligence budget</em>), and structured transparency
                        protects those weights, but neither chapter specifies where the weights come from. The system is
                        incomplete in precisely the way a combustion engine is incomplete without fuel: the machinery is
                        specified, but the input that makes it run is not.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <p class="callout-title">The Diagnosis</p>
                        <p>Let's say you receive a problematic test and need an oncologist to follow up. Using your
                            phone, you can theoretically dial any oncologist on earth, but your phone contains near-zero
                            oncologists whose judgment you have personally evaluated. Let's say your city has hundreds
                            of oncologists, your country has tens of thousands, and in theory you could contact them one
                            by one. Each would probably answer, but each answer would contain what the oncologist
                            chooses to share, something like "yes I'm a great doctor... what is your insurance and when
                            can you come in for an evaluation?"</p>
                        <p>In a way... the oncologist is not really who you want to call. You want to call the patients,
                            people who trusted each oncologist with their life and learned whether that trust was
                            warranted. The patients have information beyond what the typical oncologist is likely to
                            disclose, such as whether the doctor listens, whether they rush, whether their diagnoses
                            prove correct, and whether their patients are cured.</p>
                        <p>However, you cannot collectively dial all the patients of the world's oncologists; even if
                            you had a team of people to help you make thousands of phone calls, you do not know the
                            names or numbers of each oncologist's patients. They are not listed anywhere you can find.
                            Some of them are almost certainly friends of friends of friends of yours... so the path to
                            an introduction might exist... but you cannot see or traverse it. Indeed, the information is

                    <h2>First Why: Why Individuals Cannot Evaluate at Scale</h2>

                    <p>Trust requires observation. If no one has ever observed a party perform, no one can trust that
                        party to perform well, one can only <em>hope</em>. One might be tempted to argue that everyday
                        life involves trusting many people one has not directly observed (e.g., taxi drivers, baristas)
                        because they are credentialed in some way. But credentials, ratings, and recommendations do not
                        create trust; they transfer it. At the origin of every trust chain, someone watched.</p>

                    <p>Consider the CV of the oncologist from the example above. It represents layers of transferred
                        trust from medical schools that observed her learn, residency programs that observed her
                        practice, and credentialing boards that reviewed her record. Patients who trust the CV are
                        trusting these institutions to have done the observation on their behalf. But after treatment,
                        successful patients hold something stronger: trust built through their own time with her,
                        perhaps through diagnoses that proved correct or through her listening when they were afraid.
                        While the CV offers borrowed trust, the relationship offers earned trust. And crucially, the
                        relationship is mutual. Because the oncologist depends on her patients for referrals and
                        reputation, if she misleads her patients, she loses something she values. This mutual dependency
                        helps to make the trust enforceable.</p>

                    <p>Sociologists call these high-trust relationships "strong ties": relationships characterized by
                        sustained interaction, emotional investment, and mutual obligation [<a href="#ref-2"
                            class="cite">2</a>]. The last element is crucial. Mutual obligation means both parties have
                        stakes in the relationship's continuation... and therefore both bear costs if they betray it.
                        This is what makes strong-tie trust enforceable rather than merely hopeful.</p>

                    <p>The problem is that building strong-tie relationships requires attention, and attention is
                        finite. Dunbar's research establishes the constraint as universal across humans: approximately
                        150 stable relationships... a limit traced to neocortex size itself [<a href="#ref-1"
                            class="cite">1</a>].</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, NSAI requires trust assessments for millions of sources. If competitive systems
                        require data at thirty-trillion-token scale from millions of sources (see Chapter 2 for
                        details), and individuals can maintain at most 150 strong ties, the gap spans 4+ orders of
                        magnitude. That gap will not close through individual effort, and delegation is therefore
                        necessary. The question is whether delegated trust can preserve what makes strong ties work: the
                        observation, sustained interaction, emotional investment, and mutual obligation that makes
                        accountability possible.</p>

                <section id="second-why">
                    <h2>Second Why: Delegation Centralizes or Fails to Scale</h2>

                    <figure class="full-width">
                        <img src="1411.3146/ch_4_4_v1.png" alt="Second Why concept graph">

                    </figure>

                    <p>Two paths exist: delegate through individuals, or delegate through groups of individuals
                        organized as institutions. One might propose a third path, delegate to technology (to
                        algorithms), but this merely relocates the question; trusting an algorithm means trusting
                        whoever built it and deployed it. The choice reduces to individuals or institutions.</p>

                    <h3 id="institutional-path">The Institutional Path</h3>
                    <p>The institutional path appears elegant: delegate trust evaluation to AI platforms, let them
                        aggregate signals from billions of sources. But this recreates the architecture NSAI was
                        designed to escape. If users delegate trust evaluation to Google or OpenAI, those institutions
                        decide which sources are trustworthy. Control has not been distributed; it has been relocated.
                        Central institutions cannot deliver ABC by definition.</p>

                    <p>Consider data owners. As Chapter 2 documented, 6+ orders of magnitude of data remains siloed
                        because data owners do not trust institutional intermediaries with their information. This
                        resistance is rational. Data owners are one of millions; the institution has no particular stake
                        in protecting any single owner's interests. Without mutual stakes, data owners have no mechanism
                        to hold institutions accountable, only the hope that the institution will behave well.</p>

                    <p>Consider governments. The company Klout processed forty-five billion social interactions daily to
                        score 750 million users [<a href="#ref-11" class="cite">11</a>], attracted $200 million in
                        acquisition value, and served over two thousand business partners. Western society shut it down
                        anyway... the day GDPR took effect. Privacy regulation made Klout's level of trust evaluation
                        illegal by making its level of surveillance illegal. Yet, GDPR is not a local legislation
                        targeted at specific companies like Klout, it is a European wide paradigm shift in privacy
                        expectations, inspiring similar legislation around the world [<a href="#ref-10"
                            class="cite">10</a>].</p>

                    <p>Or consider accountability generally within western society. General trust evaluation at scale
                        requires significant surveillance and likely a significant power imbalance between the
                        surveiller and surveilled. Yet, democratic values prohibit comprehensive surveillance. There is
                        no policy that satisfies both constraints, or a widely deployed technology that circumvents
                        them. Caught between these imperatives, Western societies pay the costs of both while achieving
                        the full benefits of neither.</p>

                    <p>The result is visible in current online infrastructure. A handful of social media platforms
                        observe approximately 8.5% of all waking human experience on earth... four trillion hours
                        annually [<a href="#ref-8" class="cite">8</a>]. This is surveillance at civilizational scale,
                        yet the online trust verification problem remains woefully unsolved: half of web traffic is bots
                        [<a href="#ref-9" class="cite">9</a>], up to 30% of online reviews remain fraudulent, and state
                        actors operate troll factories at scale.</p>

                    <h3 id="individual-path">The Individual Path</h3>
                    <p>The alternative is delegation through individuals: trust your friends and colleagues to evaluate
                        sources on your behalf. This preserves what institutions cannot offer: strong-ties. Your friend
                        has 150 relationships, not two billion; you are one of 150, not one of millions; and your friend
                        depends on your continued relationship for support, reciprocity, and reputation within your
                        shared community. If your friend misleads you, they lose something they value. The mutual stakes
                        that make trust enforceable remain intact.</p>

                    <p>But individual delegation cannot reach the scale that competitive AI platforms require. The
                        Dunbar limit applies to delegated relationships as surely as direct ones. If each friend
                        evaluates within their limit of 150, and you have 150 friends, your network reaches at most
                        22,500 sources, at best 2+ orders of magnitude short of the millions of sources that competitive
                        AI systems require.</p>

                    <p>Taken together, institutions fail because they struggle to secure a public mandate for sufficient
                        surveillance, and because they cannot sustain mutual stakes at scale. Individuals preserve
                        mutual stakes but cannot reach AI-level scale. Both paths appear closed.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>Consider what happens when nodes of vastly different cardinality connect. One institution sits in
                        the middle, billions of sources connect on one side, billions of users on the other. Now ask:
                        what stake does each party have in the relationship? The institution has two billion
                        connections; if it loses one, it loses one two-billionth of its network. But a user has perhaps
                        150 relationships, constrained by the same cognitive limits that necessitated delegation in the
                        first place.</p>

                    <figure class="full-width">

                    <p>The stakes are asymmetric. The institution can betray counterparties at negligible cost; their
                        departure costs it nothing it would notice. Mutual stakes require that both parties in each
                        relationship lose something meaningful if the relationship fails. When one side of an edge has
                        two billion connections and the other side has 150, the asymmetry is structural, and
                        accountability cannot survive it.</p>

                        <p>A patient receives a troubling test result and needs an oncologist. Two paths exist.</p>
                        <p><strong>The platform path.</strong> The patient consults a review platform with two billion
                            users and tens of thousands of oncologist reviews. The platform's algorithm surfaces a
                            five-star physician. The patient books an appointment, receives treatment, and dies eighteen
                            months later from a cancer that a competent oncologist would have caught. The review was
                            fake... posted by a marketing firm working for the oncologist and undetected by the
                            platform. The patient is dead, but what does the platform lose? One two-billionth of its
                            user base. The loss is invisible to the platform; the accountability is virtually
                            nonexistent.</p>
                        <p><strong>The friend path.</strong> The patient asks their 150 friends whether anyone knows a
                            good oncologist. No one does—oncology is specialised, and the patient's immediate network
                            lacks relevant experience. The patient asks friends to ask their friends: 150 times 150
                            yields 22,500 people, still no oncologist referral with direct experience. The information
                            exists somewhere in the social fabric, but three hops away, four hops away, beyond the reach
                            of the patient's strong-tie network. The patient gives up and returns to the platform.</p>
                        <p>Both paths fail. One has reach without accountability. The other has accountability without
                            reach. The branching puzzle: is there a third path that offers both?</p>

                </section>

                <section id="third-hypothesis">
                    <h2>Third Hypothesis: Reach via Recursion</h2>

                    <p>There is a third path: recursion. If each node maintains k connections and trust propagates
                        through chains of depth H, theoretical reach scales as O(k<sup>H</sup>). Fifty connections
                        across six hops has the theoretical potential to reach fifteen billion sources:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;"><strong>Reach = k<sup>H</sup> = 50<sup>6</sup> =
                            15,625,000,000</strong></p>

                    <p>This is mathematical possibility, not a claim about actual social networks, but the pattern has
                        precedent. Word of mouth has operated this way for thousands of years; the spread of
                        fire-making, agriculture, and religious ideas all propagated through peer networks without
                        central coordination. Academic citation networks, PageRank, and Wikipedia exhibit similar
                        structure: researchers cite dozens of sources, pages link to dozens of others, editors assess
                        within their capacity, and no central node determines outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Reframing the Problem</h3>
                    <p>This perspective reframes the problems documented in the three Whys as one of scaling existing
                        word-of-mouth mechanisms. Word of mouth involves several operations: sharing information with
                        contacts, filtering what to pass along, aggregating responses, and weighting sources by trust.
                        Communication infrastructure has upgraded word of mouth's mechanisms unevenly for centuries. The
                        printing press scaled sharing while leaving filtering and aggregation at human speed. Radio and
                        television extended this pattern. Digital infrastructure continued it... sharing now operates
                        instantly, but filtering, aggregating, and trust-weighting still require human attention at each
                        hop.</p>

                    <p>And when sharing scales but aggregation does not, bottlenecks form at whoever can aggregate,
                        concentrating power into an attention economy [<a href="#ref-7" class="cite">7</a>]. The
                        branching problem and the corresponding collapse of mutual stakes trace to the uneven
                        development of communication infrastructure.</p>

                    <h3>The Requirement</h3>
                    <p>The mathematics establish that reach without branching is possible in principle. Two questions
                        remain before this possibility becomes useful. First, does trust survive recursive depth?
                        Information passing through six hops might degrade at each link&mdash;the telephone game. If the
                        chain corrupts what it carries, reach is worthless. The Second Hypothesis addresses this
                        question. Second, can coordination costs be reduced enough to compete with platforms? Real
                        networks impose costs at every hop: phone calls, explanations, waiting for callbacks. A chain
                        that could theoretically reach a relevant expert in four hops might take weeks in practice. Word
                        of mouth has the right structure but the wrong speed. The First Hypothesis addresses this
                        question.</p>

                <section id="second-hypothesis">
                    <h2>Second Hypothesis: Delegation Without Concentration</h2>

                    <p>The Third Hypothesis established that recursive networks can achieve global reach without
                        high-branching nodes, but mathematical possibility does not guarantee practical implementation.
                        The Second Why documented a historical pattern: delegation systems either centralize under
                        competitive pressure or fail to reach useful scale. The question is whether recursive trust
                        propagation can avoid this pattern.</p>

                    <p>The mechanism described below scales without concentrating because no node can substitute its
                        judgment for another's. Whether this architectural property proves sufficient against
                        competitive dynamics is an empirical question that this thesis does not resolve, but the
                        structure differs from previous delegation systems in ways worth examining.</p>

                    <h3>The Propagation Mechanism</h3>
                    <p>Each participant maintains trust assessments $w_{u,v}^d \in [0,1]$ for direct contacts, where $d$
                        indexes the domain. Trust propagates via iterated computation. Let $T_h(n)$ denote participant
                        $n$'s trust score at hop $h$. Trust originates with the querying user and propagates as each
                        participant distributes to contacts:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">$$\text{Map}_n(T_h(n)) = \{(v, T_h(n) \cdot w_{n,v}^d) : v \in
                        \text{contacts}(n)\}$$</p>

                    <p>Recipients aggregate incoming trust via probabilistic OR:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">$$T_{h+1}(m) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{k}(1 - T_h(n_i) \cdot w_{n_i,m}^d)$$
                    </p>

                    <p>After $H$ iterations, trust scores determine how much each source influences the response. The
                        final budget allocation normalizes these scores:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;">$$B(s) = \frac{T_H(s)}{\sum_{s'} T_H(s')}$$</p>

                    <h3>Why It Scales</h3>
                    <p>The mechanism requires O(k · H) operations per participant per query, where k is the number of
                        contacts and H is the number of hops. With k ≈ 50 and H ≈ 6, each participant performs roughly
                        300 operations regardless of total network size. The computational cost of reaching billions of
                        sources through recursive propagation does not require any participant to perform billions of
                        operations.</p>

                    <h3>Why It Decentralizes</h3>
                    <p>Each participant controls only their own weights (the assessments they maintain about their own
                        contacts) and no participant controls anyone else's. When trust propagates through a chain, each
                        node applies its own assessments, but those assessments affect only the next hop. No node
                        observes the full chain from query to response, and no node substitutes its judgment for the
                        judgment of other participants in the network.</p>

                    <p>Path redundancy reinforces this distribution if network structure approximates the mathematics
                        from the Third Hypothesis. Whether real adoption produces such structure, or whether clustering
                        creates de facto bottlenecks despite the architecture, remains an empirical question. The
                        architecture makes concentration structurally difficult by ensuring that influence over outcomes
                        requires controlling weights across many independent participants. It does not make
                        concentration impossible, and competitive dynamics could produce outcomes the architecture alone
                        cannot prevent.</p>

                    <h3>The Requirement</h3>
                    <p>The mechanism scales and decentralizes in principle. After $H$ iterations, each source has a
                        trust score $T_H(s)$ reflecting the paths through which trust reached it. Two requirements
                        remain before this mechanism becomes practically useful: the trust scores must convert into a
                        synthesized response, and participation must be cheap and secure enough that people actually use
                        the system. The First Hypothesis addresses these requirements.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="first-hypothesis">
                    <h2>First Hypothesis: The Machinery Exists</h2>

                    <p>The Second Hypothesis showed that recursive delegation scales and decentralizes in principle.
                        Whether anyone uses it depends on two requirements: participation must be cheap enough to
                        compete with platforms, and secure enough that honest participation is rational.</p>

                    <h3>What Deep Voting Provides</h3>
                    <p>Recursive consultation through social networks presently requires human effort at every hop:
                        formulating requests, providing context, waiting for responses, following up when people forget.
                        A chain that could theoretically reach a relevant expert in four hops might take days or weeks
                        in practice. Meanwhile, platform queries from frontier AI systems can return results in seconds.
                    </p>

                    <p>Deep voting addresses this gap by describing how this analog process could be done digitally,
                        plausibly giving a path towards a significant reduction in cost and latency. It did this in part
                        by separating weight specification from query-time coordination. Participants record trust
                        assessments in advance, specifying which contacts they trust for which domains. When a query
                        arrives, the system propagates trust according to these pre-recorded weights without requiring
                        human attention.</p>

                    <h3>What Structured Transparency Provides</h3>
                    <p>Recording trust assessments in a digital system creates vulnerability that face-to-face word of
                        mouth does not. If assessments are observable, employers could identify employees who distrust
                        company sources, governments could identify citizens who trust opposition voices, and commercial
                        actors could infer relationships for targeted manipulation. Rational participants facing these
                        risks would either decline to participate or provide strategically dishonest assessments.</p>

                    <p>Structured transparency addresses this by enabling something analogous to end-to-end encryption
                        for the trust propagation process. Information flows from participants to intended recipients
                        without requiring any central intermediary to observe unencrypted weights or messages.</p>

                    <h3>The Gap Closes</h3>
                    <p>The First Why identified a gap between cognitive capacity for trust evaluation—approximately 150
                        relationships—and the number of sources requiring evaluation—approximately 10<sup>9</sup>. Seven
                        orders of magnitude.</p>

                    <p>Recursive depth addresses the gap structurally. Deep voting replaces human coordination with
                        computation, making recursive consultation plausibly fast enough to compete with platforms.
                        Structured transparency protects assessments from observation, making honest participation
                        possible without exposure.</p>

                    <p>The contribution is not the pattern of recursive trust propagation, which has operated in human
                        societies for as long as those societies have existed. The contribution is identifying the
                        infrastructure barriers—coordination cost and privacy risk—and providing machinery that
                        addresses them.</p>

                <section id="conclusion">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>This chapter asked whether the problems documented in the three Whys admit a solution. The Third
                        Hypothesis established that recursive networks can achieve global reach without requiring any
                        node to exceed Dunbar-scale operation. The Second Hypothesis showed that a specific propagation
                        mechanism scales computationally and distributes authority structurally. The First Hypothesis
                        showed that deep voting addresses coordination cost and structured transparency addresses
                        privacy risk.</p>

                    <p>What the chapter establishes is architectural possibility, not guaranteed outcome. Whether the
                        machinery proves sufficient to motivate adoption, and whether the architectural properties prove
                        robust against competitive dynamics, remain empirical questions.</p>

                    <p>The chapter also proposed a reframe. The three Whys traced concentration not to any fundamental
                        constraint on distributed trust, but to uneven development of communication
                        infrastructure—sharing scaled while filtering, aggregating, and trust-weighting remained at
                        human speed. The contribution of this thesis is not the pattern of recursive trust propagation,
                        which is ancient. The contribution is identifying the infrastructure gaps that prevented the
                        pattern from operating at scale, and surveying and re-framing recently proposed machinery that
                        addresses them.</p>
