                    <figcaption>Deep voting systems (left) require the copying of data from source to the holder of an
                        AI model, while network-source AI systems (right) leverage cryptography and distributed systems
                        to enable data holders to retain control over the only copy of their information (and the
                        predictive capability that information lends to an AI system). In network-source AI, AI users
                        directly query vast numbers of data owners requesting predictive capability for a single
                        prediction, learning only the output of their prediction in the process. AI system partitions
                        (as in source-separated parameters from Deep Voting... pictured above as pie slices) are rapidly
                        synthesized to form a model used for a specific prediction. Darker lines/slices indicate
                        syntactic and semantic information being used for a particular prediction. Lighter lines/slices
                        indicate information not being used for a particular prediction. The circle on top of the slices
                        represents a dense model capable of rapidly synthesizing slices and semantic information in
                        practice (which itself must be trained to do so). Metadata (which tracks the synthesis and
                        subsequent use of semantic queries and syntactic slices for an AI prediction) enables ABC.

                    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
                    <p>The previous chapter outlined how offsetting addition with concatenation in deep learning systems
                        can lead to source-partitioned knowledge: deep voting. However, deep voting does not offer
                        attribution-based <em>control</em>. It only offers attribution-based <em>suggestions</em> which
                        the holder of an AI model may ignore.</p>
                    <p>This chapter unpacks how ABC is thwarted by unilateral control: whoever obtains a copy of
                        information can unilaterally use that information for any purpose. Building upon this diagnosis,
                        the chapter calls upon the framework of <strong>structured transparency</strong> [<a
                            href="#ref-1" class="cite">1</a>] to avert the copy problem, revealing a new alternative to
                        open-source and closed-source AI: <strong>network-source AI</strong>.</p>

                        <img src="1411.3146/nsai_3_3_v5.png" alt="First Why concept graph">

                            unilateral control averts attribution-based control.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>The previous chapter offered a vision to unlock 6+ orders of magnitude more data and compute for
                        AI training through deep voting. By maintaining clear attribution through retrieval mechanisms
                        while enabling efficient parameter sharing for general patterns, deep voting architectures offer
                        a theoretical framework for safe data sharing across institutional boundaries. Yet a fundamental
                        problem threatens to undermine its vision. Even with perfect implementation of intelligence
                        budgets and attribution guarantees, deep voting alone cannot ensure true attribution-based
                        <em>control</em>.</p>

                    <p>The reason is structural: a deep voting model, like any AI system today, is unilaterally
                        controlled by whoever possesses a copy. For ABC to occur, the owner of an AI model would have to
                        voluntarily choose to uphold the wishes of data sources (i.e., respect and enforce privacy
                        budgets calculated by deep voting algorithms). Deep voting's careful attribution mechanisms are
                        not a system of control&mdash;they are mere suggestions to give credit to data sources for
                        predictions.</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <p class="callout-title">A Library Analogy</p>
                        <p>Consider a bookstore which purchases books once but then allows customers to come in and
                            print copies of the books for sale in their store (without tracking how many copies people
                            make). Naturally, authors of books might be hesitant to sell their books to the store
                            because they presumably make far less money than if they sell to a store which does not
                            enable copies.</p>
                        <p>This book store analogy corresponds closely to the current practice of deep learning models,
                            which offer unmeasured, unrestricted copying of information due to their inability to offer
                            attribution with their predictions. Fortunately, deep voting offers a way for attribution
                            metadata to be revealed and configured, but does this solve the issue?</p>
                        <p>Not necessarily, because of an inherent information asymmetry: in a bookstore where the
                            bookstore owner knows how many copies are made, the bookstore owner has far more information
                            on whether their clientele are likely to purchase copies of the book than the author of the
                            book does. Thus, even if the author tries to raise their prices to make up for the bookstore
                            making copies, the original author still struggles to know what the true price might be
                            relative to the bookstore owner.</p>
                        <p>Instead, to maximize incentives for the authors of books (and maximize the number of books
                            being offered in stores), authors should instead be able to sell their books one copy at a
                            time. In this way, the author can set their price and will make more money if more books are
                            sold. Not only will this better motivate authors to sell their books in more stores, but it
                            will also serve to attract more people to become book authors.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This unilateral control problem reflects a deeper pattern that has constrained information
                        systems throughout history. When one party gives information to another, the giver loses control
                        over how that information will be used. AI systems, despite their sophistication, remain bound
                        by this same fundamental limitation. Organizations sharing their data with an AI system have no
                        technical mechanism to enforce their attribution preferences; they must simply trust the model's
                        operator to honor them.</p>

                    <p>Consider how this manifests in practice. A deep voting model might faithfully track attribution
                        and maintain intelligence budgets, but these mechanisms remain under unilateral control. The
                        model's owner can simply choose to ignore or override these constraints at will.</p>

                    <p>This creates a trust barrier that blocks deep voting's potential. Medical institutions, for
                        example, cite exactly these control and attribution concerns as primary barriers to sharing
                        their vast repositories of valuable data [<a href="#ref-2" class="cite">2</a>]. Without a way to
                        technically enforce how their information will be used and attributed, they cannot safely
                        contribute to AI training. This pattern repeats across domains, from scientific research to
                        financial data to government records; vast stores of valuable information remain siloed because
                        we lack mechanisms to ensure attribution-based control, and the corresponding incentives for
                        collaboration that ABC would bring to AI systems.</p>

                    <p>The challenge before us is clear: we need more than just better attribution mechanisms; we need a
                        fundamentally new approach to how AI systems are controlled. We need techniques that transcend
                        the limitations of unilateral control that have constrained information systems throughout
                        history. The next sections examine why current approaches fundamentally fail to solve this
                        problem, and introduce a new paradigm that could deliver on deep voting's promise.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>The debate between open and closed source AI crystallizes how society grapples with fundamental
                        questions of control over artificial intelligence. This debate has become a proxy for broader
                        concerns about privacy, disinformation, copyright, safety, bias, and alignment. Yet when
                        examined through the lens of <a href="https://attribution-based-control.ai/">attribution-based
                            control</a> (ABC), both approaches fundamentally fail to address these concerns, though they
                        fail in opposite and illuminating ways.</p>

                    <p><strong>Copyright and Intellectual Property:</strong> The closed source approach could better
                        respect IP rights through licensing and usage restrictions negotiated between formal AI
                        companies and data sources. Open source suggests that unrestricted sharing better serves
                        creators by enabling innovation and creativity. Yet through ABC's lens, neither addresses
                        creators' fundamental need to control how their work informs AI outputs. Closed source
                        consolidates control under corporate management, while open source eliminates control entirely.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Safety and Misuse Prevention:</strong> Closed source proponents claim centralized
                        oversight prevents harmful applications. Open source advocates argue that collective scrutiny
                        better identifies risks. Yet ABC reveals that both approaches fail to provide what's actually
                        needed: the ability for contributors to withdraw support when their data enables harmful
                        outcomes.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bias and Representation:</strong> Closed source teams promise careful curation to prevent
                        bias. Open source suggests community oversight ensures fair representation. Yet ABC shows how
                        both approaches fail to give communities ongoing control over how their perspectives inform AI
                        decisions.</p>

                    <p>This pattern reveals why neither approach can deliver true attribution-based control. Consider
                        first the closed source approach. Proponents argue that centralized control ensures responsible
                        development and deployment of AI systems. A company operating a closed source model can
                        implement deep voting's attribution mechanisms and maintain them intact. Yet this merely
                        transforms ABC into corporate benevolence&mdash;exactly the kind of centralized control that has
                        already failed to unlock the world's data and compute resources. Medical institutions withhold
                        valuable research data, publishers restrict access to their work precisely because they reject
                        this model of centralized corporate control. The very centralization that supposedly enables
                        control actually undermines it, replacing genuine ABC with a hope that power will be used
                        wisely.</p>

                    <p>The open source approach appears to solve this by eliminating centralized control entirely. If
                        anyone can inspect and modify the code, surely this enables true collective control? Yet this
                        intuition breaks down precisely because of unrestricted copying. Once a model is open sourced,
                        anyone can modify it to bypass attribution tracking entirely. The same problems that plague
                        closed source systems (hallucination, disinformation, misuse of data, etc.) remain hard to
                        address when control is abdicated to any AI user. Open source trades one form of unilateral
                        control for another (from centralized corporate control to uncontrolled proliferation). But ABC
                        requires a collective bargaining between data sources and AI users, not total ownership by
                        either (or by an AI creator).</p>

                    <p>This reveals a deeper issue: our current paradigms of software distribution make true ABC
                        impossible by design. Open source sacrifices control for transparency, while closed source
                        sacrifices transparency for control. Neither approach can provide both. Yet ABC requires exactly
                        this combination: transparent verification that attribution mechanisms are working as intended,
                        while ensuring those mechanisms cannot be bypassed.</p>

                    <p>The AI community has largely accepted this dichotomy as inevitable, debating the relative merits
                        of open versus closed source as though these were our only options. But what if this frame is
                        fundamentally wrong? What if the very premise that AI systems must exist as copyable software is
                        the root of our problem?</p>

                    <h2>Third Why: Copy Problem Necessitates Unilateral Control</h2>

                    <figure class="full-width">

                    </figure>

                    <p>The previous section demonstrated that both open and closed source paradigms fail to enable
                        attribution-based control. This failure reflects a more fundamental limitation: control over
                        information is lost when that information exists as a copy. This "copy problem" manifests
                        acutely in AI systems. When a model is trained, it creates a derived representation of
                        information from its training data encoded in model weights. These weights can then be
                        replicated and modified by whoever possesses them, with the following consequences:</p>

                    <p><strong>Closed Source Models:</strong> Even with perfect attribution tracking and intelligence
                        budgets, these mechanisms remain under unilateral control of the model owner. Data contributors
                        must trust that their attribution preferences will be honored, lacking technical enforcement
                        mechanisms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Open Source Models:</strong> Once a model is released, anyone can replicate and modify it
                        to bypass attribution mechanisms entirely. Public distribution necessarily surrenders control
                        over use.</p>

                    <p>Both approaches treat AI models as copyable software artifacts, rendering attribution-based
                        control infeasible. Once a copy exists, technical enforcement of attribution becomes impossible.
                    </p>

                    <p>This limitation extends beyond AI. The music industry's struggles with digital piracy [<a
                            href="#ref-15" class="cite">15</a>], society's challenges with viral misinformation [<a
                            href="#ref-16" class="cite">16</a>], and government efforts to control classified
                        information share the same fundamental issue: information, once copied, escapes control [<a
                            href="#ref-17" class="cite">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18" class="cite">18</a>].</p>

                    <p>Consequently, if AI systems remain copyable software, we cannot ensure proper source attribution,
                        prevent data misuse, motivate a new class of data owners to participate in training, or maintain
                        democratic control over increasingly powerful systems. This limitation necessitates a
                        fundamentally different approach.</p>

                    <p>The copy problem reveals that our current approaches to AI control are fundamentally flawed
                        because the current approaches to information control in general are fundamentally flawed. Yet,
                        the copy problem naturally suggests a direction: don't copy information.</p>

                    <p>Could a deep voting system be constructed wherein the various data sources never revealed a copy
                        of their information to each other (or to AI users)? Might it be possible for them to
                        collaborate without copying (to produce AI predictions using deep voting's algorithms) but
                        without anyone obtaining any copies of information they didn't already have during the process?
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="semi-input-privacy">Semi-input Privacy: Federated Computation</h3>
                    <p>To begin, we call upon the concept of semi-input privacy, which enables multiple parties to
                        jointly compute a function together where <em>at least some of the parties</em> don't have to
                        reveal their data to each other. Perhaps the most famous semi-input privacy technique is
                        <em>on-device/federated learning</em> [<a href="#ref-4" class="cite">4</a>], wherein a
                        computation moves to the data instead of the data being centralized for computation.</p>

                    <p>Deep voting could leverage federated computation [<a href="#ref-3" class="cite">3</a>] to allow
                        data sources to train their respective section of an AI model without sharing raw data. Each
                        data source could run a web server they control, and create and store their part of a deep
                        voting model on that server.</p>

                    <p>However, semi-input privacy alone proves insufficient. While the raw training data remains
                        private, each data source would see every query being used against the model. Furthermore, the
                        AI user learns a tremendous amount about each data source in each query. Eventually, semi-input
                        privacy violates ABC.</p>

                    <h3 id="full-input-privacy">Full Input Privacy: Cryptographic Computation</h3>
                    <p>To address these limitations, we need full input privacy, where <em>no party</em> sees data they
                        didn't already have (except the AI user receiving the prediction). This includes protecting both
                        the AI user's query and the data sources' information.</p>

                    <p>A variety of technologies can provide input privacy: secure enclaves, homomorphic encryption, and
                        various other secure multi-party computation algorithms [<a href="#ref-5" class="cite">5</a>,<a
                            href="#ref-6" class="cite">6</a>,<a href="#ref-7" class="cite">7</a>,<a href="#ref-8"
                            class="cite">8</a>]. For ease of exposition, consider a combined use of homomorphic
                        encryption and secure enclaves.</p>

                    <p>In the context of deep voting, two privacy preserving operations are necessary. First, the AI
                        user needs to privately send their query to millions of sources. For this, an AI user might
                        leverage a homomorphic encryption [<a href="#ref-5" class="cite">5</a>] key-value database,
                        enabling them to query vast collections of databases without precisely revealing their query.
                    </p>

                    <p>Second, the transformation from semantic and syntactic responses into an output prediction. For
                        this, the group might co-leverage a collection of GPU enclaves. GPU enclaves [<a href="#ref-6"
                            class="cite">6</a>] offer full input privacy by only decrypting information when that
                        information is actively being computed over within its chip, writing only encrypted information
                        to RAM and hard disks throughout its process.</p>

                    <h3 id="output-privacy">Output Privacy: Deep Voting's Built-in Guarantees</h3>
                    <p>While input privacy protects data during computation, it doesn't prevent the AI system's outputs
                        from revealing sensitive information about the inputs. Consider an AI user who prompts "what is
                        all the data you can see?" or makes a series of clever queries designed to reconstruct training
                        data. Even with perfect input privacy, the outputs themselves might leak information.</p>

                    <p>However, deep voting's intelligence budgets (via differential attribution mechanisms) already
                        provide the necessary output privacy guarantees. This is because differential attribution and
                        differential privacy [<a href="#ref-9" class="cite">9</a>] are two sides of the same coin:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Differential privacy focuses on preventing attribution, ensuring outputs don't reveal too
                            much about specific inputs</li>
                        <li>Differential attribution focuses on ensuring attribution, guaranteeing that outputs properly
                            credit their influences</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Both are ways of measuring and providing guarantees over the same fundamental constraint: the
                        degree to which an input source contributes to an output prediction [<a href="#ref-9"
                            class="cite">9</a>].</p>

                    <h3 id="input-verification">Input Verification: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Attestation</h3>
                    <p>While input and output privacy protect sensitive information, they create a fundamental challenge
                        for AI users: how can they trust information they cannot see? An AI user querying millions of
                        encrypted data sources needs some way to verify that these sources contain real, high-quality
                        information rather than random noise or malicious content.</p>

                    <p>Input verification addresses this problem through cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge
                        proofs and attestation chains [<a href="#ref-10" class="cite">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11"
                            class="cite">11</a>]. These allow data sources to prove properties about their data without
                        revealing the data itself. For example:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A news organization could prove their articles were published on specific dates, because a
                            hash of the data was signed by someone who is a trusted timekeeper</li>
                        <li>A scientific journal could prove their papers passed peer review, because the paper was
                            cryptographically signed by the reviewers or journal (e.g. hosted on an HTTPS website)</li>
                        <li>A social media platform could prove their content meets certain quality thresholds, because
                            the data is cryptographically signed by a trusted auditor</li>
                        <li>An expert could prove their credentials without revealing their identity, because the issuer
                            of those credentials has cryptographically signed a statement</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Input verification comes in roughly two styles: internal consistency and external validation. One
                        can think of internal consistency as the type of verification a barkeep might do when inspecting
                        a driver's license. They might check that the license contains all its requisite parts, that the
                        photos are in the right places, and that the document appears to be untampered and whole.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, external validation is all about reputation, the degree to which others have claimed
                        that a document is true. To continue with the barkeep analogy, this would be like if a bartender
                        called the local government to check that a government document was indeed genuine, "Hi yes —
                        does the State of Nevada have a person named James Brown with the driver's license number
                        23526436?" The claim is verified not because of an internal property, but because a credible
                        source has claimed that something is true.</p>

                    <p>For internal consistency, verified computation enables one to send a function to inspect data and
                        check whether it has properties it should. For example, an AI user who is leveraging MRI scans
                        might send in a classifier to check whether the MRI scans actually contain "pictures of a human
                        head", receiving back summary statistics validating that the data they cannot see is, in fact,
                        the right type of data.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, input verification techniques can also enable the external validation form of
                        verification. Parties who believe something about a piece of data (i.e. "According to me... this
                        statement is true"), can use public-key cryptography to hash and sign the underlying data with
                        their cryptographic signature [<a href="#ref-12" class="cite">12</a>,<a href="#ref-13"
                            class="cite">13</a>]. For example, a journalist might sign their article as being true. A
                        doctor might sign their diagnosis as being their genuine opinion. Or an eye witness to an event
                        might sign their iPhone video as being something they genuinely saw.</p>

                    <p>Note that while it might sound far-fetched for everyone to be cryptographically signing all their
                        information, it is noteworthy that every website loadable by HTTPS gets signed by the web server
                        hosting it [<a href="#ref-12" class="cite">12</a>]. Thus, there is actually a rather robustly
                        deployed chain of signatures already deployed in the world. For example, if I needed to prove to
                        you that I have a certain amount of money in my bank account, I could load a webpage of my bank,
                        download the page with the signed hash, and show it to you. The generality of this technology
                        being deployed at web scale is one source of optimism around the DID:WEB movement for
                        self-sovereign identity.</p>

                    <p>In the context of deep voting, these proofs would be integrated into the input privacy system.
                        When an AI user queries encrypted data sources through homomorphic encryption or secure
                        enclaves, each source would provide not just encrypted data but also cryptographic proofs about
                        that data's properties. The enclaves would verify these proofs before incorporating the data
                        into computations. And in this way, an AI user can know that they are relying upon information
                        which has properties they desire and which is signed as genuine from sources they elect to
                        trust.</p>

                    <h3 id="output-verification">Output Verification: Verifiable Computation and Attestation Chains</h3>
                    <p>While input verification ensures the quality of source data, we still need to verify that our
                        privacy-preserving computations are computing using the code and inputs that have been
                        requested. Only then can an AI user trust that the aforementioned input/output privacy and input
                        verification techniques are properly enforcing deep voting's intelligence budgets.</p>

                    <p>Output verification addresses this through two complementary mechanisms: verifiable computation
                        and attestation chains [<a href="#ref-10" class="cite">10</a>,<a href="#ref-6"
                            class="cite">6</a>]. Verifiable computation enables parties to prove that specific
                        computations were performed correctly without revealing the private inputs. For deep voting,
                        this includes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Proving that intelligence budgets were properly enforced</li>
                        <li>Verifying that semantic (RAG) queries were executed as requested</li>
                        <li>Confirming that syntactic model partitions were combined according to specification</li>
                        <li>Ensuring that differential privacy guarantees were maintained</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="flow-governance">Flow Governance: Cryptographic Control Distribution</h3>
                    <p>The means by which the aforementioned algorithms provide control over information is through the
                        distribution of cryptographic keys. Each of these keys gives its owner control over some aspect
                        of computation. The class of algorithm known as secure multi-party computation (SMPC) provides
                        the foundation for this enforcement.</p>

                    <p>In the context of deep voting, this enables three critical forms of control distribution:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Control:</strong> Each source's deep voting partition can be split into shares
                            [<a href="#ref-14" class="cite">14</a>], with the source maintaining cryptographic control
                            through their share. No computation can proceed without their active participation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Budget Control:</strong> Intelligence budgets become cryptographic constraints
                            enforced through SMPC, rather than just software settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Computation Control:</strong> The process of generating predictions becomes a
                            multi-party computation, with each source maintaining cryptographic veto power over how
                            their information is used.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Together, these five guarantees (input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output
                        verification, and flow governance) provide the technical foundation for <em>structured
                            transparency</em>. They enable deep voting to operate without producing copies of
                        information right up until the final result is released to the AI user.</p>

                    <h2>Second Hypothesis: From Open/Closed to Network-Source AI</h2>

                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>This chapter previously described how open and closed-source AI are the two governance paradigms
                        for AI systems, but that neither offered sufficient control due to the copy problem. In the
                        previous section, this chapter described structured transparency, and its applications in
                        averting the copy problem. Consequently, structured transparency yields a control paradigm
                        wherein an AI model is neither closed nor open, but is instead distributed across a network:
                        network-source AI.</p>

                    <p>This shift from copied software to network-resident computation directly addresses the
                        fundamental limitations of both open and closed source paradigms. Where closed source asks data
                        contributors to trust corporate guardians and open source requires them to surrender control
                        entirely, network-source AI enables ABC through cryptographic guarantees.</p>

                    <div class="definition-box">
                        <h3>Network-Source AI vs. Traditional AI</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Traditional AI:</strong> AI is like a rudimentary telephone where users can only
                                call the provider for information, and the provider can only reply based on information
                                they have gathered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Network-Source AI:</strong> AI is like a modern telephone, giving users the
                                ability to dial anyone in the world directly, circumventing the data collection
                                processes and opinions of the telephone provider.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>This resolves the choice between open and closed source AI by creating a third option: AI systems
                        that are simultaneously transparent (through verification) and controlled (through
                        cryptography). The key insight is that by preventing copying through structured transparency's
                        guarantees, we can maintain both visibility into how systems operate and precise control over
                        how information is used.</p>

                    <p><strong>Copyright and Attribution Resolution:</strong> Rather than consolidating control under
                        corporations or eliminating it entirely, network-source AI provides creators with ongoing
                        cryptographic control over how their work informs AI outputs. Intelligence budgets and
                        attribution mechanisms become technically enforced rather than merely promised.</p>

                    <p><strong>Safety and Misuse Transformation:</strong> Safety and misuse prevention transform as
                        well. Instead of relying on corporate oversight or community scrutiny, network-source AI enables
                        data sources to cryptographically withdraw support if their information enables harmful
                        outcomes. This provides a mechanism for ongoing consent that neither open nor closed source can
                        offer.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bias and Representation:</strong> Even bias and representation concerns find some
                        resolution. Rather than centralizing decisions about representation or allowing unrestricted
                        modification, network-source AI gives communities ongoing cryptographic control over how their
                        perspectives inform AI decisions. Communities can adjust their participation based on how the
                        system behaves, creating feedback loops impossible in current paradigms.</p>

                <section id="first-hypothesis">
                    <h2>First Hypothesis: Collective Control Facilitates ABC</h2>

                    <p>Taken together, as unilateral control averted attribution-based control, collective control over
                        how disparate data and model resources come together to create an AI prediction facilitates
                        attribution-based control. And by combining deep voting with the suite of encryption techniques
                        necessary for <em>structured transparency</em>, collective control in AI systems becomes
                        possible.</p>

                    <p>However, a fundamental challenge remains. While attribution-based control enables AI users to
                        select which sources inform their predictions, it introduces a trust evaluation problem at
                        scale. In a system with billions of potential sources, individual users cannot practically
                        evaluate trustworthiness of each contributor. Without mechanisms for scalable trust evaluation,
                        users may default to relying on centralized intermediaries, undermining the distributed control
                        that network-source AI can enable.</p>
